<b>Privacy Policy:</b><br>

The recordings you make in Poot Messenger are stored on your iPhone and are completely private. We will never hear or have access to any of your recordings. We do not know your name, phone number, email address or any identifying information about you. The only people other than yourself who will hear your recordings are the people you share them with via the app.

From time to time, this app may update itself via the The App Store with new or improved features. Please check back here periodically to see whether our privacy policy has changed.
